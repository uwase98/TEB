Present
Once upon a time, there was a boy 
Who was named Julio Ricardo Montoya
He had three dogs and a small pig
But he was very hungry 
So he ate his pig
Julio LOVED bacon
But he decided he loves dogs more so he ate everything
This gave him a stomach ache :(
So he had to go to the hospital, but he had no car
So he called his friend Drake to take him to the hospital 
On the ride there, they listened to some music and got in their feels
They accidently touched hands on the center console and realized they were meant for eachother 
The song playing was "Baby" by Justin Bieber 
They started singing along 
and Drake looked at Julio in the eyes 
Drake got so lost in Julios eyes that he let go of the steering wheel
Next thing you know it, they had crashed into Navid's office
They got blood all over Navid's students homework :/
So Navid had his TEB students clean up the mess
Drake and Julio were unconscious 
Before Julio lost conciousness, he thanked his pets for giving him a stomach ache and landing him with Drake
Darren got so fed up with all the b.s. that he took out a bomb and blew up the office
This didn't give Navid time to get them to the hospital
But Darren saved the day and carried them halfway, until he cramped upped and had to take a break
He hadn't eaten all day and he decided to eat Julio's feet
He couldn't believe how tasty they were!
Darren thought Julios toe hairs tasted so good that he decided to give him a big kiss on the lips
Meanwhile, Navid is attempting to grade bloody papers
But he got distracted by Darren and Julios PDA, so he gave the students all As
Darren's kiss was so awful that it made Julio throw up all the animals he had eaten earlier 
Suddenly, Drake woke up and began singing "Marvin's Room"
Then out of no where, Jucie WRLD came in and hit drake in the back of the head with a passion fruit to re claim the saddest rapper in the game
This made Drake go unconcious again
But luckily, Navid was able to perform CPR to save his life 
In the mean time, one of Navid's student; Bryan was trying to figure out how he would kidnap Julio
All while Julio was dealing with the animals he had just thrown up
Bryan decided that Julio wasn't worth kidnapping, and instead, kidnapped the animals and started a zoo
This became the biggest zoo in the Bay Area, all the kids loved it
So Navid took the TEB students here for a field trip
