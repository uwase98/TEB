Present
Once upon a time, there was a boy 
Who was named Julio Ricardo Montoya
He had three dogs and a small pig
But he was very hungry 
So he ate his pig
Julio LOVED bacon
But he decided he loves dogs more so he ate everything
This gave him a stomach ache :(
So he had to go to the hospital, but he had no car
So he called his friend Drake to take him to the hospital 
On the ride there, they listened to some music and got in their feels
They accidently touched hands on the center console and realized they were meant for eachother 
The song playing was "Baby" by Justin Bieber 
They started singing along 
and Drake looked at Julio in the eyes
